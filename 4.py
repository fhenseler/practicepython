# Exercise 4
# Create a program that asks the user for a number and then prints out a list of all the divisors of that number. 
# (If you donâ€™t know what a divisor is, it is a number that divides 
# evenly into another number. For example, 13 is a divisor of 26 because 26 / 13 has no remainder.)

    print("List of divisors for number " + str(number) + " : " + str(divisorList))
