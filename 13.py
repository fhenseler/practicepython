# Exercise 13
# Write a program that asks the user how many Fibonnaci numbers to generate and then generates them. 
# Take this opportunity to think about how you can use functions. 
# Make sure to ask the user to enter the number of numbers in the sequence to generate.
# (Hint: The Fibonnaci seqence is a sequence of numbers where the next number in the sequence 
# is the sum of the previous two numbers in the sequence. The sequence looks like this: 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, â€¦)

import myFunctions

userInput = myFunctions.get_int("How many Fibonacci numbers in the sequence?: ")

def generateFibonacciSequence(number: int) -> list:
    i = 1
    if number == 0:
        sequence = []
    elif number == 1:
        sequence = [1]
    elif number == 2:
        sequence = [1, 1]
    elif number > 2:
        sequence = [1, 1]
        while i < (number - 1):
            sequence.append(sequence[i] + sequence[i-1])
            i += 1
    return sequence
