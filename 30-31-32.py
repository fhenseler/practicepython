# Exercises 30, 31 and 32

# You can start your Python journey anywhere, but to finish this exercise you will have to have 
# finished Parts 1 and 2 or use the solutions (Part 1 and Part 2).

# In this exercise, we will finish building Hangman. In the game of Hangman, 
# the player only has 6 incorrect guesses (head, body, 2 legs, and 2 arms) before they lose the game.

# In Part 1, we loaded a random word list and picked a word from it. In Part 2, we wrote the logic 
# for guessing the letter and displaying that information to the user. In this exercise, we have 
# to put it all together and add logic for handling guesses.

# Copy your code from Parts 1 and 2 into a new file as a starting point. Now add the following features:

# Only let the user guess 6 times, and tell the user how many guesses they have left.
# Keep track of the letters the user guessed. If the user guesses a letter they already guessed, 
# donâ€™t penalize them - let them guess again.
# Optional additions:

# When the player wins or loses, let them start a new game.
# Rather than telling the user "You have 4 incorrect guesses left", display some picture art 
# for the Hangman. This is challenging - do the other parts of the exercise first!
